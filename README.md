# React Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my React learning journey! This repository contains my daily progress as I learn and practice React.js — one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.

## 📅 Structure

Each day of learning is organized into separate folders.


## 📚 What I'm Learning:
- React Basics & JSX
- Components & Props
- State Management with Hooks
- Handling Events
- useEffect Hook
- Conditional Rendering
- Lists and Keys
- React Router
- and much more...

## 🎯 Goal:
To become confident in React.js for building real-world projects and eventually move to React-based frameworks like Next.js.
