# REACT LEARNING 

## What I learned today-

- What is hook
- useState()

### Hooks in react

- Hooks are like magic tools that give your components (your little building blocks of a website) special powers.

### useState()

- It helps your component remember things.
- Example: A counter that remembers numbers.

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
