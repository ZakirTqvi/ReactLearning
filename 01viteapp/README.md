# React + Vite

## Important Points

- The first letter of component names, (function names, and file names) should be capitalized.

- Some libraries will force you to name the extension as .jsx 

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
